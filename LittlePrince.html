    <p> As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in <br>
    my arms and set out walking once more. <span1>I felt deeply <br>
    moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was <br>
    carrying a very fragile teasure.</span1> <span2>It seemed to me, even, <br>
    that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span2> In the <br>
    moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed <br>
    eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I <br>
    said to myself: <span3>"What I see here is nothing but a <br>
    shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span3> <br>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a <br> 
    half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span3>"What moves me <br>
    so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping <br>
    here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose <br>
    that shines through his whole being like the flame <br>
    of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span3> And I felt <br>
    him to be more fragile still. <span1>I felt the need of <br>
    protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that <br>
    might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span1> <br>
